            <strong>We exist to improve the lives of software developers.</strong> Our Northstar is to make developers
            happier, more productive and more focused on the core problems they are trying to solve.

            We believe that happy, productive, focused developers can boost an organization’s ability to accomplish
            its
            goals and by extension, it just makes good business sense.
          </p>
          <p class="lead lh-180">
            Every context switch, UI/UX friction, breakage, migration, etc. that a developer experience is compounded
            and
            results in a huge loss of productivity affecting the team and organization at large.
          </p>
          <p class="lead lh-180">
            A developer’s daily workflow should be straightforward, integrated and fast. Making the tools they are
            required to use more integrated, easier to learn and understand and smarter can have a transformative
            effect
            on the whole organization.
