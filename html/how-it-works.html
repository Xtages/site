                        <p>
                            Yes! You can create a sandbox GitHub organization, which is free and available for anyone, using this <a href="https://github.com/organizations/plan">link</a> and
                            install the Xtages Connector GitHub app there. When you create a new Xtages project, a repository will be created under that
                            GitHub organization.

                        <h3>How is my database secured?</h3>
                        <p>
                            We manage the database instance for you. We create a password for it that you can access through environment variables.
                            This password is created and stored in a secret manager where they are encrypted and secure.
                            That being said, you can change the password to the instance and we wonâ€™t have access to it.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Your data is encrypted at rest and your database instance is not shared. If you ever decide to
                            leave Xtages you can take your data with you.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How is my service secured?</h3>
                        <p>
                            We give our customers an *.xtages.dev HTTPS URL to access their service, this ensures that the
                            information in transit is secure.
                            Xtages also provides the capability to associate your own domain and point it to your service
                            running in production. You can read more about that in our <a href="https://docs.xtages.com/projects/custom-domains/">documentation</a>.
                        </p>
                        <h3>How are my logs secured?</h3>
                        <p>
                            Your build and application/service logs are encrypted at rest.
                        </p>
                        <h3>Do you have a secrets manager?</h3>
                        <p>
                            We currently donâ€™t have a secrets manager, though weâ€™re planning to add that capability very soon.
